<div>When you think about it, says Jerry Cuomo, software shouldn’t work at all. There are too many dependencies – too many variables at play – for anything to work. <br><br>But, like Douglas Adams' “<a href=""http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Infinite_Improbability_Drive"">Infinite Improbability Generator</a>” or the equally improbable bumblebee that <a href=""http://claesjohnsonmathscience.wordpress.com/article/why-bumblebees-can-fly-yvfu3xg7d7wt-65/"">flies in defiance of aerodynamics</a>, software does indeed work. And it works well. That it can drive orders-of-magnitude improvements in productivity and efficiency is due not only to its limitless flexibility but also to the smarts and vision of the individuals who build it. <br><br>To the benefit of many <Keyword>IBM</Keyword> clients, <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/profiles/html/profileView.do?key=da99f8e4-6f55-4a92-b59d-f3cb5d6de285&lang=en"">Jerry Cuomo</a> is one such individual. <br><br>At <Keyword>IBM</Keyword>, Cuomo is a Fellow, a Distinguished Engineer and CTO of <a href=""http://www.ibm.com/software/websphere/"">Websphere</a>. He's also <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/gcuomo/?lang=en"">a blogger</a>, and in the run-up to next week’s <a href=""http://www.ibm.com/software/websphere/events/impact/""><Keyword>IBM</Keyword> Impact event</a> he found time to talk about the ever-shifting dynamics of enterprise software for others in the <Keyword>IBM</Keyword> blogosphere such as myself. <br><br><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/impact""><img alt=""IBM Impact 2012"" src=""http://www.livestream.com/filestore/logos/beb6773e-d124-7b36-7efb-1a87021d3808-banner.jpg"" style="" width:400px;  display:block; margin: 0 auto;text-align: center; position:relative;""></a> <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Engaging enterprise design</span><br><br>Cuomo sees businesses entering a new era driven by the confluence and interplay of four major tech trends: mobile, social, big data and cloud. Most leaders know that harnessing even one of these trends can bring ample business benefits. But savvy technologists such as Cuomo know that it’s when you make them work together – for example, through <Keyword>IBM</Keyword> Software capabilities like <a href=""http://www.ibm.com/software/products/us/en/category/SW666"">Connectivity and integration</a>, <a href=""http://www.ibm.com/software/products/us/en/category/SWX00"">Enterprise marketing management</a> or <a href=""http://www.ibm.com/software/products/us/en/category/bpm-software"">Business process management</a> – that the transformative benefits really show through. <br><br>“I’m humbled,” he said at the outset of the call. “Humbled by the game-changing era we’re entering.”<br><br>Cuomo calls this new approach “Engaging enterprise design.” It rests on four pillars.<br><br><ul><li><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Externalizing your enterprise: </span>Think of it like a smartphone: underneath a sleek and shiny exterior is a complex interplay of data and processes. Your apps and APIs are a window into those processes. With a mobile presence you can optimize that interplay to deliver benefits directly to the consumer. <br> </li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Synchronizing with the outside world: </span>Once your data and processes are “out there,” they need to keep pace. Consumers expect your organization to deliver instant updates across platforms, apps and the web. <br> </li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Securing, Scaling and Success: </span>Is your customer’s smartphone a safe place to be? Nearly everything we do now takes place in the cloud. What if someone builds apps on top of your APIs? You need to be sure your stuff is still safe.<br> </li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Insights to Action: </span>This is where big data and the analytics come in. A steady stream of data about your customers’ habits and behavior can reveal new opportunities to serve them better and keep them happier longer.</li></ul><br>In embracing this new principle, Cuomo says organizations can build powerful applications that benefit deliver immediate benefits to individual users while operating at internet scale. <br><br>How? <br><br>Let’s look at a retail example: A customer walks into your store, smartphone in tow. She checks in through Facebook or Foursquare, or perhaps your own mobile app. That check-in triggers a query in your system into their purchase history and location to find out what she likes. From there, the system then queries another system to check the store’s current inventory to see if similar products are available. From there, an alert is triggered that generates a discount coupon in the form of a QR code that’s sent directly to her smart phone. She redeems the discount at the register and leaves happy. <br><br><a '="""" href=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7071/6970645224_c41edd7e6c.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""image"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7071/6970645224_c41edd7e6c.jpg"" style="" width:400px;  display:block; margin: 0 auto;text-align: center; position:relative;""></a> A simple example? Perhaps. But picture it happening, says Cuomo, thousands of times a day, in hundreds of locations, in different languages, all at the same time. That’s where the “internet scale” aspect comes in. With an engaging enterprise design, this retailer can offer personalized service to each customer, on their terms, in real time. Further, this retailer's team of business analysts can explore the data in aggregate for insights into their customers' broad-based preferences, which in turn can optimize their purchasing and procurement processes by locking down suppliers of the next big thing. <br><br><b>Prepare to engage, indeed</b><br><br>Will it really work? You can play the skeptic card if you like, Cuomo says, right before he reminds us that a lot of business leaders said this whole web thing was a fad, too. </div><div> </div><div><b><Keyword>IBM</Keyword> Impact starts Monday, April 30.
