<p>One year ago this month, IBM’s <Keyword>Watson</Keyword> computing system triumphed on the TV quiz show Jeopardy! The historic victory signaled how far scientists have advanced in making computers that are capable of feats that few people could have imagined just a few decades ago. Congressman Rush Holt (NJ-12) was one of five members of Congress who had a chance to experience <Keyword>Watson</Keyword> up close.  Along with his colleagues, he participated in a demonstration match and even won a round, though the computing system went on to win in the end. For Holt, <Keyword>Watson</Keyword> illustrates the importance of technology to U.S. economic competitiveness, the need for greater investments in R&D and the urgency to expand and improve math and science education.</p><p><a href=""http://asmarterplanet.com/blog/2012/03/for-congressman-rush-holt-watson-points-to-the-need-for-long-term-investments-in-science.html""><em>Click here to view the embedded video.</em></a></p><p>Read <a href=""http://blog.nj.com/njv_guest_blog/2012/03/us_rep_rush_holt_what_i_learne.html"">his op-ed </a>in the Newark Star-Ledger.</p><!-- start wp-tags-to-technorati 1.02 --><p class='technorati-tags'>Technorati Tags: <a class='technorati-link' href='http://technorati.com/tag/Analytics' rel='tag' target='_self'>Analytics</a>, <a class='technorati-link' href='http://technorati.com/tag/ibm+watson' rel='tag' target='_self'><Keyword>ibm</Keyword> <Keyword>watson</Keyword></a>, <a class='technorati-link' href='http://technorati.com/tag/learning+machines' rel='tag' target='_self'>learning machines</a>, <a class='technorati-link' href='http://technorati.com/tag/Rush+Holt' rel='tag' target='_self'>Rush Holt</a></p><!-- end wp-tags-to-technorati --><div class=""AWD_like_button ""><iframe src=""http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fasmarterplanet.com%2Fblog%2F2012%2F03%2Ffor-congressman-rush-holt-watson-points-to-the-need-for-long-term-investments-in-science.html&send=false&layout=standard&width=&show_faces=false&action=like&colorscheme=light&font=arial&height=40"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""border:none; overflow:hidden; width:px; height:40px;"" allowTransparency=""true""></iframe></div><img src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ASmarterPlanet/~4/C8cYYvKB2Ro"" height=""1"" width=""1""/>
