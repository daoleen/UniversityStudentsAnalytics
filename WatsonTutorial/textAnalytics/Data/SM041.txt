To meet these demands, KDHCDtapped IBM's storage systems to create a new storage platform that reallocatesresources and saves a significant amount of data space with thin-provisioningtechnology. Virtualization creates a smaller hardware footprint so the hospitalalso saved on power and cooling costs. KDHCD now has a consolidated storageenvironment that provides the scalability, ease-of-management, and security tosupport critical healthcare data management for the hospital.</span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: ""Times New Roman"",""serif""; color: black;""></span></span></span></p></div>
