It was the second year of my MBA program, and I had already accepted a job offer from <Keyword>IBM</Keyword>, so I was rooting for my own team. I was so excited that I stayed until the very end to get the last <Keyword>Watson</Keyword> T-shirt they handed out as a door prize. Today, my profile picture on Facebook shows me proudly wearing the shirt.</p><p>So, you could say I’m a poster child for <Keyword>IBM</Keyword>.</p><p>But I really represent something that’s much bigger than <Keyword>IBM</Keyword>. I’m pursuing one of the most exciting and important new professions that’s coming on strong in the 21<sup>st</sup> century: business analytics. I’m a  consultant who combines expertise in analytics technology with business know-how. I call myself a business strategy quant.</p><p>I had another thrill a couple of weeks ago when Steve Lohr of the New York Times interviewed me for a story about the need for more people with my skills to turn the huge amount of data in our world into useful insights. The <a href=""http://nyti.ms/ySDz5G"">story was published today</a> and will hopefully encourage even more students to follow my professional path.</p><p><span id=""more-15154""></span>Business analytics is the practice of using some of the latest advances in computer science, involving really sophisticated mathematical algorithms, to help businesses work better. The way I think about it, I’m using my skills to build a smarter planet–one organization at a time.</p><p>I never could have imagined this life when I was a child growing up in China. I dreamed of being a secret agent, like 007. But what really fascinated me was numbers. I competed in the Chinese Mathematics Olympiad, and, after my family moved to California, I completed college-level advanced calculus courses during my junior year in high school. Even though few girls study electrical engineering, I chose it as my major at the University of Illinois because my high school science adviser told me it was the toughest course. Later, at Yale, I chose strategy as a focus partly because it was a gap in my skills.  It was there that I got my first taste of what consulting is really like by participating in a Yale course sponsored by <Keyword>IBM</Keyword> where I advised a real company. My husband says I always pick the hard challenges that make my life miserable. I love what I do, though.</p><p>At <Keyword>IBM</Keyword>, I’m on the road most weeks working with clients. For my last project, I helped a health insurance company come up with a strategy for educating what it expects to be a flood of new individual customers after health care reform goes into effect in 2014. I used text analytics and association algorithms to help them discover the most important topics for each kind of customer.</p><p>I’m like a detective. I help my clients uncover insights that are hidden in massive amounts of data. And I help them develop strategies that are driven by facts rather than by hunches and intuition.</p><p>I considered working for companies in Silicon Valley, but I chose <Keyword>IBM</Keyword> because it has the strongest tradition of getting patents and producing cutting-edge technology. More young people like me are realizing what a great company <Keyword>IBM</Keyword> is. <Keyword>Watson</Keyword> helps change perceptions. I think <Keyword>IBM</Keyword> is the company of the future—where people like me can help build a smarter planet. I plan on working here for a long time.</p><p> </p><!-- start wp-tags-to-technorati 1.02 --><p class='technorati-tags'>Technorati Tags: <a class='technorati-link' href='http://technorati.com/tag/IBM' rel='tag' target='_self'><Keyword>IBM</Keyword></a>, <a class='technorati-link' href='http://technorati.com/tag/Watson' rel='tag' target='_self'><Keyword>Watson</Keyword></a></p><!-- end wp-tags-to-technorati --><div class=""AWD_like_button ""><iframe src=""http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fasmarterplanet.com%2Fblog%2F2012%2F02%2Fbusiness-analytics-its-more-than-a-career-its-a-passion-for-making-the-world-better.html&send=false&layout=standard&width=&show_faces=false&action=like&colorscheme=light&font=arial&height=40"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""border:none; overflow:hidden; width:px; height:40px;"" allowTransparency=""true""></iframe></div><img src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ASmarterPlanet/~4/-9R1WiwU0WA"" height=""1"" width=""1""/>
