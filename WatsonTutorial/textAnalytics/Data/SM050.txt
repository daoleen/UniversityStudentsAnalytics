<div>With over 50 customer speakers, analysts and a wealth of <Keyword>IBM</Keyword> experts in security, Pulse 2012 will be an excellent opportunity to learn more about best practices and emerging topics in information security.  Rather than me telling you over and over again about why its such a great opportunity, I'll just show you by taking a look back at Pulse 2011.  <br><br>Steve Robinson gave a keynote address that really set the stage for the rest of the conference.  He reinforced where <Keyword>IBM</Keyword> is focusing its security capabilities and how we see the security landscape changing.  Mobile was one of the key topics of his speech and there is little doubt that BYOD became one of the most talked about topics in IT last year.  <br><br><object width=""560"" height=""315""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/pvDpUXC03IU?version=3&hl=en_US""><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""><embed allowfullscreen=""true"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/pvDpUXC03IU?version=3&hl=en_US"" transcriptional=""always"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" width=""560"" height=""315""></object><br><br>This year, expect to hear not only more about mobile security (make sure to visit the mobile security ped in the Expo center), but also the trends we think are going to become important in 2012.  With the additions of Q1 Labs and formation of the new <Keyword>IBM</Keyword> Security Systems division, this will certainly be our most exciting year at Pulse to date.<br><br>The topic of advanced and targeted attackers is consistently one that generates a great deal of discussion.  In this Pulse 2011 breakout session, Tom Cross, Manager, Threat Intelligence and Strategy, <Keyword>IBM</Keyword> X-Force, talks about approaches that you can take to combat these sophisticated attackers.  <br><br><object classid=""clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"" id=""lsplayer"" width=""480"" height=""295""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://cdn.livestream.com/grid/LSPlayer.swf?channel=ibmsoftware&clip=pla_e040e995-41f5-4736-a50e-d60a17f0ecc6&color=0xe7e7e7&autoPlay=false&mute=false&iconColorOver=0x888888&iconColor=0x777777""><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""><embed allowfullscreen=""true"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" name=""lsplayer"" src=""http://cdn.livestream.com/grid/LSPlayer.swf?channel=ibmsoftware&clip=pla_e040e995-41f5-4736-a50e-d60a17f0ecc6&color=0xe7e7e7&autoPlay=false&mute=false&iconColorOver=0x888888&iconColor=0x777777"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" width=""480"" height=""295""></object><div style=""font-size: 11px;padding-top:10px;text-align:center;width:480px"">Watch <a href=""http://www.livestream.com/?utm_source=lsplayer&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=footerlinks"" title=""live streaming video"">live streaming video</a> from <a href=""http://www.livestream.com/ibmsoftware?utm_source=lsplayer&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=footerlinks"" title=""Watch ibmsoftware at livestream.com"">ibmsoftware</a> at livestream.com</div><br><br>This year, Tom will be back to talk in more depth about the constant evolution of sophisticated attackers.  This is sure to be one of the can't miss session at Pulse again this year.  <br><br>We love hearing from the analyst community at Pulse.  Last year we were lucky enough to have Scott Crawford join us and share his thoughts on the conference.  One of the topics he noted was the importance of application security and how <Keyword>IBM</Keyword> had demonstrated real leadership in this area.  Who are we to disagree!  However, he also went on to briefly talk about ideas around integration and information management.  <br><br><object classid=""clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"" id=""lsplayer"" width=""480"" height=""295""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://cdn.livestream.com/grid/LSPlayer.swf?channel=ibmsoftware&clip=pla_067d6a8d-9fd5-4beb-a3ff-7077e5cdcdeb&color=0xe7e7e7&autoPlay=false&mute=false&iconColorOver=0x888888&iconColor=0x777777""><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""><embed allowfullscreen=""true"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" name=""lsplayer"" src=""http://cdn.livestream.com/grid/LSPlayer.swf?channel=ibmsoftware&clip=pla_067d6a8d-9fd5-4beb-a3ff-7077e5cdcdeb&color=0xe7e7e7&autoPlay=false&mute=false&iconColorOver=0x888888&iconColor=0x777777"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" width=""480"" height=""295""></object><div style=""font-size: 11px;padding-top:10px;text-align:center;width:480px"">Watch <a href=""http://www.livestream.com/?utm_source=lsplayer&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=footerlinks"" title=""live streaming video"">live streaming video</a> from <a href=""http://www.livestream.com/ibmsoftware?utm_source=lsplayer&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=footerlinks"" title=""Watch ibmsoftware at livestream.com"">ibmsoftware</a> at livestream.com</div><br><br>This was a trend that had been similarly observed by <Keyword>IBM</Keyword>, and later on in 2011 <Keyword>IBM</Keyword> acquired security intelligence vendor Q1 Labs.
