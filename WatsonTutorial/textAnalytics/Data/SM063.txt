<div>It's neither <a href=""http://graphics.latimes.com/senti-meter/"">Oscar</a> nor leg lamp, but it's a major award nonetheless. <a href=""http://www.btobonline.com/article/20120223/AWARDS/302229991/btob-announces-social-media-marketing-awards-winners-peoples-choice"">BtoB Magazine yesterday announced the winners of its Social Media Marketing Awards</a> and People's Choice finalists and I'm pleased to write that <Keyword>IBM</Keyword> took home the prize for ""Best Use of Integrated Campaign"" in the Tech Company category for the social experience at Information On Demand 2011. <br><br><object height=""315"" width=""560""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/7EgQbL5Rtjg?version=3&hl=en_US&rel=0""><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""><embed allowfullscreen=""true"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/7EgQbL5Rtjg?version=3&hl=en_US&rel=0"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" height=""315"" width=""560""></object><br><br>B2B editors explained why <Keyword>IBM</Keyword> took top honors:<br><br><blockquote><Keyword>IBM</Keyword> has pinned its reputation on advancing the cause of ""social business,"" so it was appropriate for the company to make use of one of its largest annual conferences as a showcase for its new technologies. The October Information On Demand event had  the usual branded presences on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube, but organizers went far beyond that. <br><br>Key <Keyword>IBM</Keyword> bloggers were contacted and asked to promote highlights of the conference. Six iPad-toting “social concierges” roamed the floor inviting attendees to take polls and capturing their observations in short videos. Tweets about the event were displayed on a 90-by-20-ft. screen. Some customers carried FlipCams to record man-on-the-street interviews, which were posted to YouTube. The LiveStream service was used to broadcast eight key sessions and 42 informal interviews with attendees, speakers and <Keyword>IBM</Keyword>  executives. The broadcasts were viewed more than 24,000 times during the event. The #iod11 hashtag achieved a Twitter reach of 14.3 million unique users and more than 63,000 new “likes” were recorded on relevant Facebook pages.</blockquote><br><br><object height=""315"" width=""560""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/BQ5m4-YYpto?version=3&hl=en_US&rel=0""><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""><embed allowfullscreen=""true"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/BQ5m4-YYpto?version=3&hl=en_US&rel=0"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" height=""315"" width=""560""></object><br><br>It's enough to make us blush, but it's not all there is.
