<div>I'm not normally one to engage in bad puns, but in this case I couldn't resist. You see, when more than 8,000 service management professionals descend upon the MGM Grand for our annual <Keyword>IBM</Keyword> Pulse conference and start tweeting, it's bound to cause some tremors in my social channels.<br><br>The theme of this year's conference is ""Enabling Business Without Limits,"" and over the next four days attendees will learn how to fundamentally and cost-effectively change the economics of IT and speed the delivery of innovative products and services. <br><br>With a curriculum boasting top-notch education, networking and just a little big of fun, Pulse 2012 is helping today’s leaders react with agility in changing competitive landscapes, reduce vulnerability throughout the service lifecycle, and continuously improve the business impact of the technology.<object classid=""clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"" id=""lsplayer"" height=""295"" width=""480""><param name=""movie""
