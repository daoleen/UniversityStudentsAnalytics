I'll give you a hint, the video stars IBM's very own <Keyword>Watson</Keyword>, along with some other familiar faces! And why shouldn't the video grab your attention, the UX lab will too! It's a friendly, informal environment where you can talk to designers and information developers, learn some things about your favorite products, see a sneak peak at what's coming in Connections, LotusLive, Social Messaging, mobile and more. You might even pick up a crazy hat or 2012 button. The UX lab also has some scheduled talks which will prove both fun and informative.
