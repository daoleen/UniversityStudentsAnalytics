<P>NRF kicks off each year with a reminder of why retail is the best <A href=""http://www.stern.nyu.edu/experience-stern/news-events/retail-2020"">industry</A> around. Cool companies, fun toys, smarter consumers, and a happy hour that creeps closer and closer to lunch on Tuesday afternoon. And, as retail’s annual prom, NRF always makes for happy <A href=""http://www.pgstorebrands.com/top-story-gain_their_trust__win_them_over-1350.html"">rock-star</A> reunions and adding <A href=""http://faculty.unibocconi.eu/sandrocastaldo/"">new gurus</A> to the list.<BR><BR>So what to make of the 2012 show? Here are my five thoughts.<BR><BR><STRONG>1. NRF is no longer the exclusive domain of retail CIOs.</STRONG> Sure, they are there. But functional diversity has exploded into store operations, e-commerce, and most importantly, marketing. 2012 may mark the year NRF turned the corner to become a CMO show given the rising number of marketing managers and density of cross-channel and digital marketing offerings. Vertical diversity – or the retailization of everything – was also evident. Based on the number of executives I spoke with from telco’s, I think they fully understand the need to participate in and shape the cross-channel shopping experience for their customers, versus merely providing consumer devices. Brands, banks, and public also turned out in force. And unlike last year, where “scouting” seemed the norm, most attendees in 2012 had an appetite for action backed up by budget.<BR><BR><STRONG>2. Nothing new under the sun?</STRONG> Almost everything on display was there last year in some form, with a few exceptions (our own <A href=""http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/gigaom/articles/2012_01_16_could_watson_be_your_next_personal_shopping_assistant.html""><Keyword>Watson</Keyword></A> among them). This is a good thing – the never versions were in almost every case more polished, more tightly scoped, and more ready-for-retail. How the technology would fit into a customer experience was much, much more evident. Case-in-point: Datalogic’s <A href=""http://supermarketnews.com/blog/nrf-new-self-checkout-technology"">scan portal</A>. This automated scanner has been on the floor in some way, shape, or form for three shows now. Only this time did it look like something one might actually put into a store. Even-better-if: a believable ROI.<BR><BR><STRONG>3. Mobile gets real.</STRONG> Related to the previous point, I saw a narrowing of mobile uses cases across the board, and reflection of the reality that different segments will adopt different uses cases in differing orders. Last years theme often seemed to be, “If you can do it, you can do it on a mobile.” This year: “Consumers want to do three things on mobile: store location, inventory look-up, and price-checking. Here’s how.” Even-better-if: separate mobile from tablets. <A href=""https://www-304.ibm.com/connections/blogs/retail/entry/hello_t_com_why_tablet_shopping_demands_a_new_category4?lang=en_us"">They aren’t the same</A>.<BR><BR><STRONG>4. Stores remain the axis around which channel convergence turns.</STRONG> There is no channel, there is only where your customer wants to engage your brand. And increasingly, that means the store, whether its for <A href=""https://www-304.ibm.com/connections/blogs/retail/entry/stores_1_venue_for_product_awareness3?lang=en_us"">product awareness</A>, <A href=""https://www-304.ibm.com/connections/blogs/retail/entry/stores_1_venue_for_product_research3?lang=en_us"">product research</A>, or <A href=""https://www-304.ibm.com/connections/blogs/retail/entry/stores_1_and_stickiest_channel_for_purchase3?lang=en_us"">final purchase</A>. <Keyword>IBM</Keyword> demoed SmarterCheckout, which integrates cross-channel order management with core point of sale (POS) applications. Our mobile shopping experiences showed how mobile is not taking consumers away from the store, rather it is bringing the store to them wherever they are… watching television, planning a recipe, and shopping in a different store. As I told Supermarket News, “In a mobile world, the retail store starts in my pantry or refrigerator.”<BR><BR><STRONG>5. It is hard to show “how” through “what.”</STRONG> Big analytics and visualization tools are awesome, but the real differentiation lies in the method, not the individual use cases, which tend to show only a small fraction of underlying capability. By my third booth, I was getting positively dismissive of “real-time cross-channel visibility” and “embedded analytics.” The booths that demonstrated “how” across stages of a shopping experience fared the best – and while I am partial to the <Keyword>IBM</Keyword> brand and loved our showcase, I also enjoyed the Intel, Ingenico, and Cisco booths for letting me experience the technology versus simply hearing about it.<BR><BR>Bottom line: NRF 2012 marks a great start for retail over the next twelve months, trading 2011’s wide-eyes and what-ifs for doable, testable, and better-scoped initiatives.. funded initiatives, in most cases. Time to capture that momentum.<BR><BR>Follow me <A href=""https://twitter.com/#!/SmarterRetail"">@SmarterRetail</A></P>
