<div>Every year I try to publish a set of storage trends that I believe most IT shops are trying to address and where technologies exist to help resolve.  Here are my thoughts for 2012... <br></div><div> </div><div><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""color: black;"">1) Storage breakthroughsnipping the “Digital Dark Age” in the bud</span></b></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;""><span style=""color: black;"">Since the early 1990’s, an increasing proportion of datacreated and used has been in the form of digital data. Today, the worldproduces more than 1.8 zettabytes of digital information a year.  Yet, digital storage can in many ways be more perishablethan paper. Disks corrode, bits “rot” and hardware becomes obsolete. Thispresents a real concern of a “Digital Dark Age” where digital storagetechniques and formats created today may not be viable in the future as thetechnology originally used becomes antiquated.  We’ve seen this happen—take the floppy disk for example. Astorage tool that was so ubiquitous people still click on this enduring icon to“save” their digital work and any word, presentation or spreadsheetdocuments—yet most Millennials have never seen it in person.   But new research shows storage mediums can be vastlydenser than they are today. While new form factors such as solid state diskswill help us provide more stable longer-term preservation of data, and thepromise of ""the cloud"" allows access to data anywhere, anytime.   Recently, <Keyword>IBM</Keyword> researchers combined the benefits of magnetic harddrives and solid-state memory to overcome challenges of growing memory demandand shrinking devices. Called Racetrack memory, this breakthrough could lead toa new type of data-centric computing that allows massive amounts of storedinformation to be accessed in less than a billionth of a second.  This storage research challenges previous theoreticallimits to data storage—ensuring our digital universe will always be preserved.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""color: black;""></span></b><b><span style=""color: black;"">2) Data curation will providestructure in midst of the data deluge</span></b></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;""><span style=""color: black;"">Now that we have the capability to preserve our digitaluniverse, we need to find a way to make it useful. We need to take the nextstep past data preservation to data curation.   Data curation is the active and ongoing management of datathrough its lifecycle. This smarter data categorization adds value to data thatwill help glean new opportunities, improve the sharing of information andpreserve data for later re-use.   Social media is a great example of the power of curateddata. Sites like FaceBook, Google+, Pinterest, etc. compile our digital livesand gives their users a platform to organize their content.   However, there's also a lot of work involved in selecting,appraising and organizing data to make them accessible and interpretable. Thekey is bringing data sets together, organizing them and linking them to relateddocuments and tools. If data can be stored in a way that provides context,organizations can find new and useful ways to use that data.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;""><span style=""color: black;""><b><span style=""color: black;"">3) Storage analytics will opennew business insights</span></b></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;""><span style=""color: black;"">With data curation allowing organizations the platform tobetter utilize their data, analytics will help turn that data into intelligenceand, ultimately, knowledge.   With the information that historical trending analyticsand infrastructure analytics provides, you can index and search in a moreintelligent way than ever before. By doing analytics on stored data, in backupand archive, you can draw business insight from that data, no matter where itexists.   The application of <Keyword>IBM</Keyword> <Keyword>Watson</Keyword> technology for healthcareprovides a good example. <Keyword>Watson</Keyword> collects data from many sources and is able toanalyze the meaning and context. By processing vast amounts of information andusing analytics, it can suggest options targeted to a patient's circumstances,can assist decision makers, such as physicians and nurses, in identifying themost likely diagnosis and treatment options for their patients.   Through intelligent storage and data retrieval systems, wecan learn more with the information we have today to improve service tocustomers or open new revenue streams by leveraging data in new ways.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;""><span style=""color: black;""><b><span style=""color: black;"">4) Storage becomes a celebrity– new business needs are pushing storage into the spotlight</span></b><span style=""color: black;""> </span></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;""><span style=""color: black;"">As our digital and data-driven universe expands, certainindustries are able to reach new levels of innovation by having the capacity tohouse, organize and instantaneously access information.   For example, Hollywood is known for its big budgetblockbusters, but it’s the big storage demands required by new formats such asdigital, CGI, 3D and high definition that’s impacting not just the bottom line,but studios’ ability to produce these types of movies. Data sets for movieshave become so large it’s at the petabyte level.   Filmmakers are beginning to trade in film reels for SSDsas just one day’s worth of filming can generate hundreds of terabytes of data.The popularity of these high data-generating formats means studios are lookingfor new storage technologies that can handle the demand.   The healthcare industry may even be facing an even biggerdata dilemma than the entertainment business. Take a look at the InstituteUniversity of Leipzig, in Germany, which has a major genetic study called LIFEto examine disease in populations. LIFE is cataloging genetic profiles ofseveral thousand patients to pinpoint gene mutations and specific proteins.This process alone generates multiple terabytes of data.   Even one 300-bed hospital may generate 30 terabytes ofdata per year. Those figures will only grow with higher-resolution medicalimaging, and new tools or services such as making electronic healthcare recordsavailable online. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;""><span style=""color: black;""><b><span style=""color: black;"">5) Intervention...The DataHoarder</span></b></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;""><span style=""color: black;"">In this era of Big Data, more is always better, right? Notso – especially when every byte of data costs money to store and protect.   Businesses are turning into data hoarders and spending toomuch time and money collecting useless or bad data, potentially leading tomisguided business decisions. This practice can be changed with simple policydecisions and implementing existing capabilities in technologies that exist insmarter storage, but companies are hesitant to delete any data (and many timesduplicate data) due to the fear of needing specific data down the line forbusiness analytics or compliance purposes.   Part of the solution starts with eliminating the copies.Nearly 75% of the data that exists today is a copy (IDC). By deleting anddisabling redundant information, organizations are investing in data qualityand availability for content that matters to the business. Consider the effectof unneeded data, costing money by replicating throughout an organization’s informationsystems. This outdated data can also potentially be accessed for fraud. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""color: black;"">Raisingthe quality of data is not costly—not getting it right is.</span></p></div>
