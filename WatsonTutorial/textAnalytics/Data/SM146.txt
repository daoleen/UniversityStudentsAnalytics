Bob Sutor, VP <Keyword>IBM</Keyword> Mobile Platform, talks with Scott Laningham and Todd <Keyword>Watson</Keyword> about the mobile lifecycle and the intensity of change in devices, applications, and operating systems.  The line between business applications and personal applications is blurred: people want easy-to-use business applications and enterprise-level security and protection in their personal applications.

Bob mentions the Worklife acquisition and the elegant approach it takes to multiplatform development.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/podcast/pulse2012-bobsutor-030512/pulse2012-bobsutor-030512.mp3"">MP3 Download</a> (26:03) <i>Audio-only feeds:</i> <a href=""http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/podcasts/channel-dwall.rss"">dW podcast RSS</a> | <a href=""http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=153607292"">dW iTunes channel</a><br /><div><iframe width=""560"" height=""340"" src=""http://cdn.livestream.com/embed/ibmsoftware?layout=4&clip=pla_e6801c98-1f20-43be-81f7-c6a466c28a3a&height=340&width=560&autoplay=false"" style=""border:0;outline:0"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no""></iframe></div>
