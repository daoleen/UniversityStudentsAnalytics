            <textVal val="This week I was aboard the Queen Mary in Long Beach, California!  This was a business event organized by [ Key Info Systems ], a valued IBM Business Partner.  Key Info resells IBM servers, storage and switches. The Queen Mary retired in 1967, and has been converted into a hotel and events venue.  The locals just parked their car and walked on board, but I got to stay Tuesday through Thursday in one of the cabins.  It was long and narrow, with round windows!  There were four dials for the bathtub: Cold Salt, Hot Fresh, Cold Fresh, and Hot Salt. Stepping on the boat was like walking back in time through history!  If you decide to go see it, check out the &quot;&quot;Art Deco&quot;&quot; bar at the front of the Promenade deck.  The ship is still in the water, but is permanently docked.  It is sectioned off to prevent the ocean waves from affecting it, so we did not have the nauseous moving back and forth normally associated with cruise ships.  (It is with a bit of irony that we are on the Queen Mary just days after the tragedy of the [ Costa Concordia ], the largest Italian cruise ship that ran aground near Isola de Giglio.  The captain will have to explain how he [ fell into a lifeboat ] before he had a chance to wait for everyone else to get safely off the shipwreck.  He was certainly no [ Captain Sulley ]! I am thankful that most of the 4,200 people survived the incident.) Executive Welcome Lief Morin, Founder and Chief Executive for Key Info Systems, kicked off the meeting with highlights of 2011 successes.  I have known Lief for years, as Key Info comes to the Tucson EBC on a frequent basis.  This event was designed to give his sellers an update of what is the latest for each product line, and what to look forward to in the next 12-18 months. Power Systems My colleague Pat O'Rourke from Austin EBC presented [ IBM Power Systems ], from the smallest [ POWER-based blade servers for BladeCenter ] to the largest [ Power 795 server ].  When it comes to UNIX servers, IBM is [ kickin' butt and takin' names ], leaving HP and Oracle/Sun to fend for scraps. Vision Solutions The next speaker was from Vision Solutions that provides High Availability solutions for IBM i on Power Systems.  In 2010, their company nearly doubled in size with the acquisition of Double-Take, which provides data replication for x86 servers running Windows, Linux, VMware, Hyper-V and other hypervisors.  The capabilities of Double-Take sounded similar to what IBM offers with [ Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack ] and [ Tivoli Storage Manager for Virtual Environments ]. Dinner at Sir Winston's Rather than take the &quot;&quot;Ghosts and Legends&quot;&quot; tour, I opted for dinner at the Queen Mary's signature restaurant, Sir Winston's.  This is a fancy place, so dress accordingly.  If you want the Raspberry souffl�, order it early as it takes 30 minutes to prepare! System Storage I presented on a variety of storage topics: Storage Strategy [ DS8000 Disk System ], with focus on DS8800 and the R6.2 microcode release [ XIV Storage System ], with focus on the new Gen3 hardware models and 11.0 microcode release [ Scale-Out Network Attached Storage (SONAS) ], with focus on R1.3 that we announced last October [ Tape Storage Systems ], with focus on the new TS1140 and the [ Linear Tape File System (LTFS) ] [ Storwize V7000 ], including the new Storwize V7000 Unified configuration Storage is an important part of the Key Info Systems revenue stream, so I was glad to have lots of questions and interactions from the audience. Murder Mystery Dinner The acting troupe from [ Dinner Detective ] put on quite the show for us!  With all that is going on in the world, it is good to laugh out loud every now and then. In other murder mystery dinners I have participated in, each person is assigned a &quot;&quot;character&quot;&quot; and given a script of what to say and when to say it.  This was different, we got to pick our own characters.  I chose &quot;&quot;Doctor Watson &quot;&quot;, from the Sherlock Holmes series.  Several attendees thought it was a double meaning with [ IBM Watson ], the computer that figured out the clues on Jeopardy! television game show, and has since been [ put to work at Wellpoint ] to help out the Healthcare industry. After the &quot;&quot;murder&quot;&quot; happened, two actors portraying policemen selected members of the audience to answer questions.  We didn't get a script of what to say, so everyone had to &quot;&quot;ad lib&quot;&quot;.  I was singled out as a suspect, and had fun playing along in character.  One of the attendees afterwards said he was impressed that I was able to fabricate such amusing and elaborate responses to their personal and embarassing questions.  As a public speaker for IBM , I have had a lot of practice thinking quickly on my feet. Fibre Channel and Ethernet Switches The next two speakers gave us an update on Fibre Channel and Ethernet switches, and their thoughts on the inevitability of Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE).  One of the exciting new developments is the [ Brocade Network Subscription ] which creates a flexible pay-per-use Ethernet port rental model for customers.  This is especially timely given the Financial Accounting Standards Board proposed [ FASB Change 13 ] that affects operating leases in the balance sheet. With the Brocade Network Subscription, you pay monthly for the ports you are using.  Need more ports, Brocade will install the added gear.  Use fewer ports, Brocade will take the equipment back.   There is no term endpoint or residual value like tradtional leasing, so when you are done using the equipment, give it back any time.  This is ideal for companies that may need to have a lot of Ethernet ports for the next 2-3 years, but then plan to taper down, and don't want to get stuck with a long-term commitment or capital depreciation. VMware The last speaker was from VMware.  IBM is the #1 reseller of VMware, and VMware commands an impressive 81 percent marketshare in the x86 virtualization space.  The speaker presented VMware's strategy going forward, which aligns well with IBM's own strategy, to help companies Cloud-enable their existing IT infrastructures, in preparation for eventual moves to Hybrid or Public cloud deployments. Special thanks to Lief Morin for sponsoring this event, Raquel Hernandez from IBM for coordinating my travel, and Pete, Christina and Kendrell from Key Info Systems for organizing the activities! technorati tags: IBM , Queen Mary , Key Info , Art Deco , Costa Concordia , Lief Morin , "/>

There were four dials for the bathtub: Cold Salt, Hot Fresh, Cold Fresh, and Hot Salt. Stepping on the boat was like walking back in time through history!  If you decide to go see it, check out the &quot;&quot;Art Deco&quot;&quot; bar at the front of the Promenade deck.  The ship is still in the water, but is permanently docked.  It is sectioned off to prevent the ocean waves from affecting it, so we did not have the nauseous moving back and forth normally associated with cruise ships.  (It is with a bit of irony that we are on the Queen Mary just days after the tragedy of the [ Costa Concordia ], the largest Italian cruise ship that ran aground near Isola de Giglio.  The captain will have to explain how he [ fell into a lifeboat ] before he had a chance to wait for everyone else to get safely off the shipwreck.  He was certainly no [ Captain Sulley ]! I am thankful that most of the 4,200 people survived the incident.) Executive Welcome Lief Morin, Founder and Chief Executive for Key Info Systems, kicked off the meeting with highlights of 2011 successes.  I have known Lief for years, as Key Info comes to the Tucson EBC on a frequent basis.  This event was designed to give his sellers an update of what is the latest for each product line, and what to look forward to in the next 12-18 months. Power Systems My colleague Pat O'Rourke from Austin EBC presented [ IBM Power Systems ], from the smallest [ POWER-based blade servers for BladeCenter ] to the largest [ Power 795 server ].  When it comes to UNIX servers, IBM is [ kickin' butt and takin' names ], leaving HP and Oracle/Sun to fend for scraps. Vision Solutions The next speaker was from Vision Solutions that provides High Availability solutions for IBM i on Power Systems.  In 2010, their company nearly doubled in size with the acquisition of Double-Take, which provides data replication for x86 servers running Windows, Linux, VMware, Hyper-V and other hypervisors.  The capabilities of Double-Take sounded similar to what IBM offers with [ Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack ] and [ Tivoli Storage Manager for Virtual Environments ]. Dinner at Sir Winston's Rather than take the &quot;&quot;Ghosts and Legends&quot;&quot; tour, I opted for dinner at the Queen Mary's signature restaurant, Sir Winston's.  This is a fancy place, so dress accordingly.  If you want the Raspberry souffl�, order it early as it takes 30 minutes to prepare! System Storage I presented on a variety of storage topics: Storage Strategy [ DS8000 Disk System ], with focus on DS8800 and the R6.2 microcode release [ XIV Storage System ], with focus on the new Gen3 hardware models and 11.0 microcode release [ Scale-Out Network Attached Storage (SONAS) ], with focus on R1.3 that we announced last October [ Tape Storage Systems ], with focus on the new TS1140 and the [ Linear Tape File System (LTFS) ] [ Storwize V7000 ], including the new Storwize V7000 Unified configuration Storage is an important part of the Key Info Systems revenue stream, so I was glad to have lots of questions and interactions from the audience. Murder Mystery Dinner The acting troupe from [ Dinner Detective ] put on quite the show for us!  With all that is going on in the world, it is good to laugh out loud every now and then. In other murder mystery dinners I have participated in, each person is assigned a &quot;&quot;character&quot;&quot; and given a script of what to say and when to say it.  This was different, we got to pick our own characters.  I chose &quot;&quot;Doctor Watson &quot;&quot;, from the Sherlock Holmes series.  Several attendees thought it was a double meaning with [ IBM Watson ], the computer that figured out the clues on Jeopardy! television game show, and has since been [ put to work at Wellpoint ] to help out the Healthcare industry. After the &quot;&quot;murder&quot;&quot; happened, two actors portraying policemen selected members of the audience to answer questions.  We didn't get a script of what to say, so everyone had to &quot;&quot;ad lib&quot;&quot;.  I was singled out as a suspect, and had fun playing along in character.  One of the attendees afterwards said he was impressed that I was able to fabricate such amusing and elaborate responses to their personal and embarassing questions.  As a public speaker for IBM , I have had a lot of practice thinking quickly on my feet. Fibre Channel and Ethernet Switches The next two speakers gave us an update on Fibre Channel and Ethernet switches, and their thoughts on the inevitability of Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE).  One of the exciting new developments is the [ Brocade Network Subscription ] which creates a flexible pay-per-use Ethernet port rental model for customers.  This is especially timely given the Financial Accounting Standards Board proposed [ FASB Change 13 ] that affects operating leases in the balance sheet. With the Brocade Network Subscription, you pay monthly for the ports you are using.  Need more ports, Brocade will install the added gear.  Use fewer ports, Brocade will take the equipment back.   There is no term endpoint or residual value like tradtional leasing, so when you are done using the equipment, give it back any time.  This is ideal for companies that may need to have a lot of Ethernet ports for the next 2-3 years, but then plan to taper down, and don't want to get stuck with a long-term commitment or capital depreciation. VMware The last speaker was from VMware.  IBM is the #1 reseller of VMware, and VMware commands an impressive 81 percent marketshare in the x86 virtualization space.  The speaker presented VMware's strategy going forward, which aligns well with IBM's own strategy, to help companies Cloud-enable their existing IT infrastructures, in preparation for eventual moves to Hybrid or Public cloud deployments. Special thanks to Lief Morin for sponsoring this event, Raquel Hernandez from IBM for coordinating my travel, and Pete, Christina and Kendrell from Key Info Systems for organizing the activities! technorati tags: IBM , Queen Mary , Key Info , Art Deco , Costa Concordia , Lief Morin , </value>
