Watson -inspired Storage Takes on the Cosmos: IBM is working on a project with the Institutefor Computational Cosmology (ICC) at Durham University in the U.K. and BusinessPartner OCF to build a storage system to better store and manipulate Big Datafor its cosmology research on galaxies. ICC is adopting the same IBM GeneralParallel File System technology used in the IBM Watson system to store and manage more than one petabyte of data from twosignificant projects on galaxy formation and the fate of gas outside ofgalaxies. The enhanced storage system will enable up to 50 researchers, workingcollaboratively to access and review data simultaneously. It will also help ICClearn to manage data better, storing only essential data and storing it in theright place. New Storage Platform Delivers More Personalized, VisualHealthcare: A medical archivingsolution from IBM Business Partners Avnet Technology Solutions and TeraMedica,Inc. powered by IBM systems, storage and software gives patients and caregiversinstant access to critical medical data at the point-of-care. Developed incollaboration with IBM , the medical information management offering can manageup to 10 million medical images, helping health care practitioners providebetter patient care with greater efficiency and at reduced costs. Theintegrated platform allows users to manage and view clinical images originatingfrom different treatments and providers to bring secure, consistent imagemanagement and distribution at point-of-care.  Virtualization Consolidates Storage Footprint for Medical Center: Kaweah Delta Health Care District (KDHCD), ageneral medical and surgical hospital in Visalia, Calif., needed to reduce itsoperational costs while increasing storage space. To meet these demands, KDHCDtapped IBM's storage systems to create a new storage platform that reallocatesresources and saves a significant amount of data space with thin-provisioningtechnology. Virtualization creates a smaller hardware footprint so the hospitalalso saved on power and cooling costs. KDHCD now has a consolidated storageenvironment that provides the scalability, ease-of-management, and security tosupport critical healthcare data management for the hospital."/>
