The historic victory signaled how far scientists have advanced in making computers that are capable of feats that few people could have imagined just a few decades ago. Congressman Rush Holt (NJ-12) was one of five members of Congress who had a chance to experience Watson up close.� Along with his colleagues, he participated in a demonstration match and even won a round, though the computing system went on to win in the end. For Holt, Watson illustrates the importance of technology to U.S. economic competitiveness, the need for greater investments in R&amp;D and the urgency to expand and improve math and science education.
