            <textVal val="It's neither Oscar nor leg lamp, but it's a major award nonetheless. BtoB Magazine yesterday announced the winners of its Social Media Marketing Awards and People's Choice finalists and I'm pleased to write that IBM took home the prize for &quot;&quot;Best Use of Integrated Campaign&quot;&quot; in the Tech Company category for the social experience at Information On Demand 2011. B2B editors explained why IBM took top honors: IBM has pinned its reputation on advancing the cause of &quot;&quot;social business,&quot;&quot; so it was appropriate for the company to make use of one of its largest annual conferences as a showcase for its new technologies. The October Information On Demand event had� the usual branded presences on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube, but organizers went far beyond that. Key IBM bloggers were contacted and asked to promote highlights of the conference. Six iPad-toting �social concierges� roamed the floor inviting attendees to take polls and capturing their observations in short videos. Tweets about the event were displayed on a 90-by-20-ft. screen. Some customers carried FlipCams to record man-on-the-street interviews, which were posted to YouTube. The LiveStream service was used to broadcast eight key sessions and 42 informal interviews with attendees, speakers and IBM  executives. The broadcasts were viewed more than 24,000 times during the event. The #iod11 hashtag achieved a Twitter reach of 14.3 million unique users and more than 63,000 new �likes� were recorded on relevant Facebook pages. It's enough to make us blush, but it's not all there is. This same campaign is now a finalist for the People's Choice award , to be announced March 20 at BtoB's Social Media Marketing Luncheon its Digital Edge Live conference in San Francisco. Were you there? Were you Social? Care to help us out and keep the innovation growing? Why not take a moment to place your vote ? Voting ends March 7. � Congratulations to the IOD Social Team of Crysta Anderson, Matt Carter, Alex Goldsmith, David Pittman, Tim Powers. Equally large thanks go to our roster of contributors and behind-the-scenes production wizards Stephanie Caputo, Beth Flood, Sanjay Kaupae, Scott Laningham, Jacqi Levy, Jessica Sharkey, Susan Visser, Eric Vonheim and Todd Watson ! � To see some of the great work, make sure to check out the video archives on the IBM Software Livestream or the IOD YouTube channels. �&#xA;"/>
