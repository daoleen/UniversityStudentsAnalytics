            <textVal val="Exciting news yesterday from the IBM Watson team: Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and IBM� have agreed to collaborate on the development of a powerful tool built upon IBM Watson in order to provide�medical professionals with improved access to current and comprehensive cancer data and practices. Sloan-Kettering and IBM are already developing the first applications using Watson related to lung, breast and prostate cancers, and aim to begin piloting the solutions to some oncologists in late 2012, with wider distribution planned for late 2013. Cancer is prevalent in my family, so I'm more than a bit excited about this particular announcement. The press release continues: The resulting decision support tool will help doctors everywhere create individualized cancer diagnostic and treatment recommendations for their patients based on current evidence. The initiative will combine the computational power of IBM Watson and its natural language processing ability with MSKCC�s clinical knowledge, existing molecular and genomic data and vast repository of cancer case histories, in order to create an outcome and evidence-based decision support system. The goal is to give oncologists located anywhere the ability to obtain detailed diagnostic and treatment options based on updated research that will help them decide how best to care for an individual patient. BusinessWeek covered the story here , and the Watson team also created a nifty infographic to share:&#xA;"/>
