            <textVal val="by Karen Lowe,�General Manager, Global Retail Industry at IBM Next week, a large group of IBMers will be heading to the Javits Center in New York for retail industry�s biggest tradeshow of the year, the National Retail Federation�s (NRF�s) Big Show. This year, NRF�s Big Show will give us the opportunity to demonstrate the many ways IBM is working to make retail smarter, through our rich portfolio of solutions, industry-leading software, new acquisitions, research projects and assets, POS technologies and more. One of the key ways we�ll be profiling our capabilities as well as IBM�s vision of the future of shopping, is through a wide variety of exciting demos in our booth.�� I thought I�d take just a few moments to give you a sneak preview of just three of these: a view into IBM's experiential shopping zone Interactive Shopping Using Your TV Our model shopper, named �Lilly�, will show conference attendees how she can go about furnishing her new condo from the comfort of her sofa. She can control her Smart TV with her tablet computer, while accessing consumer reviews, product availability, measurements and more.� She accesses info on the items she sees in commercials, and gets side-by-side product comparisons to help her make decisions. Finally, she makes the purchase with her mobile wallet. Grocery Shopping on Steroids In this demo �Lilly� consolidates multiple shopping lists from her kids, goes about stocking her refrigerator �virtually�, and get suggestions on where to find gluten�free pizza. Additional elements of her shopping experience are depicted by a smoothie recipe popping up on her smart phone, and by an automated offer of VIP delivery service because her order is over $100. All this is intended to illustrate how the retail experience of the future will revolve around personalized offers, made by retailers who know you and your shopping history, wherever and whenever you shop. Watson IBM�s Watson won a historic �Jeopardy!� match against the game�s two top all-time human champions in February last year. Watson understands human language and can evaluate hundreds of millions of pages of material to provide correct answers in seconds. In the future, Watson could enable retailers by empowering store/service associates to interact more effectively with consumers, giving them real-time coaching about what may be of interest to individual shoppers, and vastly improving the customer�s shopping experience. If you�re coming to the NRF�s Big Show, be sure to stop by our booth � #2105 (Hall 3B Entrance) � to say hello and to see what IBM has to offer! � Technorati Tags: commerce , Karen Lowe , nrf , retail&#xA;"/>
