So, a good decisionmanagement topic to cover is how to help employees improve the effectiveness oftheir daily professional interactions -- with customers, partners and suppliers,as well as those for back office operations -- because every interactioninvolves some aspect of decision making. When added up, all those interactions (anddecisions) either erode or elevate organizational effectiveness. � Why iseffectiveness important? Effectiveness has to do with quality, or, put another way, the abilityto &quot;&quot;produce the desired effect&quot;&quot; (Merriam-Webster, www.m-w.com). Froma technology standpoint, many organizations are looking at how they can producethe desired effect, faster and more consistently, through better decisionsupport to their employees. The use of a decision support solution can assistin this objective by narrowing down the number of potential options for a givensituation and providing guidance in choosing between various options (e.g., usingscoring to rank a set of viable choices). � In 2011, IBM received a lot of attention for its Watson system, which is able to analyzelarge amounts of unstructured information against natural language queries andcome up with the highly accurate responses. While the initial demonstration of Watson was on the quiz TV show Jeopardy, a number of real-world uses are nowbeing developed in areas such as healthcare; one example is focusing onproviding disease diagnosis and treatment options decision support for medicalprofessionals through its ability to analyze massive amounts of medicalresearch. There are many other solutions where Watson can provide value withits unmatched power, but it's good to know that most everyday decision supportscenarios can be handled through standard software applications. � Understandingdecision support scenarios. In fact, a large number of decision support needs are for deterministicscenarios, where there is a known result for given situation. Returning to theexample of healthcare, there are many cases where a critical patient situationcan be avoided by checking against well defined restrictions or indicators. Byrunning a patient's medical information through a rules-based application, medicalpractitioners can be warned if a certain medication could have an adverseeffect based on factors such as age, weight, other prescribed medications, etc.The rules-based application acts as an automated assistant, reducing the riskfor both patient and provider. As more patient information is collecteddigitally, event processing can be used in conjunction with business rules toalert care providers proactively, responding to specified trends in a patient'scondition using readings from blood tests, EKGs, pacemakers and other medicaldevices. There are many deterministic scenarios in every industry -- the valueof creating decision support applications in these areas is to ensurecompliance and improve employee productivity by reducing the need to handlerepetitive tasks that can be more efficiently handled through an automatedsystem. � Of course, notall situations have a straightforward &quot;&quot;given this, do that&quot;&quot; type ofdefinition. In many cases, there can be several appropriate alternatives orvarying degrees of certainty based on the information that is provided.

From a back officeperspective, the combination of event processing, business rules and predictiveanalytics are being used in decision support areas such as risk/fraud alertsand case prioritizations in order to ensure people are focusing their attentionwhere there is the greatest need. � So, howdo you determine which approaches can meet the decision support needs for yourorganization? � Start by asking your employees     to identify repeatable problems where they struggle with too much     information or too many options.

            <value>As we moveforward into the new year, most organizations (including &lt;Keyword&gt;IBM&lt;/Keyword&gt;) are implementingplans to improve their performance from last year. So, a good decisionmanagement topic to cover is how to help employees improve the effectiveness oftheir daily professional interactions -- with customers, partners and suppliers,as well as those for back office operations -- because every interactioninvolves some aspect of decision making. When added up, all those interactions (anddecisions) either erode or elevate organizational effectiveness.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial&quot;&quot;&gt;�&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial&quot;&quot;&gt;Why iseffectiveness important?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial&quot;&quot;&gt; Effectiveness has to do with quality, or, put another way, the abilityto &quot;&quot;produce the desired effect&quot;&quot; (Merriam-Webster, www.m-w.com).
