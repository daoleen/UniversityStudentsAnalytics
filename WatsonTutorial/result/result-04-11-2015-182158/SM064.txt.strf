Take a look at the InstituteUniversity of Leipzig, in Germany, which has a major genetic study called LIFEto examine disease in populations. LIFE is cataloging genetic profiles ofseveral thousand patients to pinpoint gene mutations and specific proteins.This process alone generates multiple terabytes of data.�� Even one 300-bed hospital may generate 30 terabytes ofdata per year. Those figures will only grow with higher-resolution medicalimaging, and new tools or services such as making electronic healthcare recordsavailable online. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&quot; style=&quot;&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;color: black;&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;color: black;&quot;&quot;&gt;5) Intervention...The DataHoarder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&quot; style=&quot;&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;color: black;&quot;&quot;&gt;In this era of Big Data, more is always better, right? Notso � especially when every byte of data costs money to store and protect.�� Businesses are turning into data hoarders and spending toomuch time and money collecting useless or bad data, potentially leading tomisguided business decisions. This practice can be changed with simple policydecisions and implementing existing capabilities in technologies that exist insmarter storage, but companies are hesitant to delete any data (and many timesduplicate data) due to the fear of needing specific data down the line forbusiness analytics or compliance purposes.�� Part of the solution starts with eliminating the copies.Nearly 75% of the data that exists today is a copy (IDC). By deleting anddisabling redundant information, organizations are investing in data qualityand availability for content that matters to the business. Consider the effectof unneeded data, costing money by replicating throughout an organization�s informationsystems. This outdated data can also potentially be accessed for fraud. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;color: black;&quot;&quot;&gt;Raisingthe quality of data is not costly�not getting it right is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</value>
