Afghanistan&#xD;
&#xD;
Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
Afghanistan&#xD;
&#xD;
Background:  Afghanistan's recent history is characterized by war&#xD;
and civil strife, with intermittent periods of relative calm and&#xD;
stability. The Soviet Union invaded in 1979 but was forced to withdraw 10&#xD;
years later by anti-Communist mujahidin forces supplied and trained by the&#xD;
US, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and others. Fighting subsequently continued&#xD;
among the various mujahidin factions, giving rise to a state of warlordism&#xD;
that spawned the Taliban in the early 1990s. The Taliban was able to seize&#xD;
most of the country, aside from Northern Alliance strongholds primarily&#xD;
in the northeast, until US and allied military action in support of the&#xD;
opposition following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks forced the&#xD;
group's downfall. The four largest Afghan opposition groups met in Bonn,&#xD;
Germany, in late 2001 and agreed on a plan for the formulation of a new&#xD;
government structure that resulted in the inauguration of Hamid KARZAI&#xD;
as Chairman of the Afghan Interim Authority (AIA) on 22 December 2001.&#xD;
In addition to occasionally violent political jockeying and ongoing&#xD;
military action to root out remaining terrorists and Taliban elements,&#xD;
the country suffers from enormous poverty, a crumbling infrastructure,&#xD;
and widespread land mines.&#xD;

&#xD;
Economy Afghanistan&#xD;
&#xD;
Economy - overview:  Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked&#xD;
country, highly dependent on farming and livestock raising (sheep and&#xD;
goats). Economic considerations have played second fiddle to political&#xD;
and military upheavals during two decades of war, including the nearly&#xD;
10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended 15 February 1989). During&#xD;
that conflict one-third of the population fled the country, with Pakistan&#xD;
and Iran sheltering a combined peak of more than 6 million refugees.&#xD;
Gross domestic product has fallen substantially over the past 20 years&#xD;
because of the loss of labor and capital and the disruption of trade&#xD;
and transport; severe drought added to the nation's difficulties&#xD;
in 1998-2001. The majority of the population continues to suffer&#xD;
from insufficient food, clothing, housing, and medical care, problems&#xD;
exacerbated by military operations and political uncertainties. Inflation&#xD;
remains a serious problem. Following the US-led coalition war that led&#xD;
to the defeat of the Taliban in November 2001 and the formulation of&#xD;
the Afghan Interim Authority (AIA) resulting from the December 2001 Bonn&#xD;
Agreement, International efforts to rebuild Afghanistan were addressed at&#xD;
the Tokyo Donors Conference for Afghan Reconstruction in January 2002,&#xD;
when $4.5 billion was collected for a trust fund to be administered&#xD;
by the World Bank. Priority areas for reconstruction include the&#xD;
construction of education, health, and sanitation facilities, enhancement&#xD;
of administrative capacity, the development of the agricultural sector,&#xD;
and the rebuilding of road, energy, and telecommunication links.&#xD;

has overtaken it in recent years. Bermuda has developed into a highly&#xD;
successful offshore financial center. A referendum on independence was&#xD;
soundly defeated in 1995.&#xD;

Economy Bermuda&#xD;
&#xD;
Economy - overview:  Bermuda enjoys one of the highest per capita&#xD;
incomes in the world, with its economy primarily based on providing&#xD;
financial services for international business and luxury facilities for&#xD;
tourists. The effects of 11 September 2001 have had both positive and&#xD;
negative ramifications for Bermuda. On the positive side, a number of&#xD;
new reinsurance companies have located on the island, contributing to&#xD;
the expansion of an already robust international business sector. On&#xD;
the negative side, Bermuda's already weakening tourism industry - which&#xD;
derives over 80% of its visitors from the US - has been further hit as&#xD;
American tourists have chosen not to travel. Most capital equipment&#xD;
and food must be imported, with the US serving as the primary source&#xD;
of goods, followed by the UK. Bermuda's industrial sector is small,&#xD;
although construction continues to be important. Agriculture is limited,&#xD;
only 6% of the land being arable.&#xD;

Background:  The Portuguese colony of Timor declared itself independent&#xD;

campaign of pacification followed, during which time an estimated&#xD;
100,000 to 250,000 individuals lost their lives. On 30 August 1999,&#xD;
in a UN-supervised popular referendum, the people of Timor Timur&#xD;
voted for independence from Indonesia. On 20 May 2002, East Timor was&#xD;

next three years, however, a massive international program, manned by&#xD;
5,000 peacekeepers (8,000 at peak) and 1,300 police officers, led to&#xD;
substantial reconstruction in both urban and rural areas. By mid-2002,&#xD;
all but about 50,000 of the refugees had returned. The country faces&#xD;
great challenges in continuing the rebuilding of infrastructure and the&#xD;
strengthening of the infant civil administration. One promising long-term&#xD;
project would be development of oil resources in nearby waters.&#xD;

Economy Ecuador&#xD;
&#xD;
Economy - overview:  Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich&#xD;
agricultural areas. Because the country exports primary products such&#xD;
as oil, bananas, and shrimp, fluctuations in world market prices can&#xD;
have a substantial domestic impact. Ecuador joined the World Trade&#xD;
Organization in 1996, but has failed to comply with many of its accession&#xD;
commitments. The aftermath of El Nino and depressed oil market of 1997-98&#xD;
drove Ecuador's economy into a free-fall in 1999. The beginning of 1999&#xD;
saw the banking sector collapse, which helped precipitate an unprecedented&#xD;
default on external loans later that year. Continued economic instability&#xD;
drove a 70% depreciation of the currency throughout 1999, which forced&#xD;
a desperate government to &quot;&quot;dollarize&quot;&quot; the currency regime in 2000. The&#xD;
move stabilized the currency, but did not stave off the ouster of the&#xD;
government. Gustavo NOBOA, who assumed the presidency in January 2000,&#xD;
has managed to pass substantial economic reforms and mend relations&#xD;
with international financial institutions. Ecuador completed its first&#xD;
standby agreement since 1986 when the IMF Board approved a 10 December&#xD;
2001 disbursement of $96 million, the final installment of a $300 million&#xD;
standby credit agreement.&#xD;

Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
Taiwan&#xD;
&#xD;
Background:  In 1895, military defeat forced China to cede Taiwan&#xD;
to Japan, however it reverted to Chinese control after World War&#xD;
II. Following the Communist victory on the mainland in 1949, 2 million&#xD;
Nationalists fled to Taiwan and established a government using the 1947&#xD;
constitution drawn up for all of China. Over the next five decades,&#xD;
the ruling authorities gradually democratized and incorporated the&#xD;
native population within its governing structure. This culminated in&#xD;
2000, when Taiwan underwent its first peaceful transfer of power from&#xD;
the Nationalist to the Democratic Progressive Party. Throughout this&#xD;
period, the island has prospered to become one of East Asia's economic&#xD;
&quot;&quot;Tigers.&quot;&quot; The dominant political issues continue to be the relationship&#xD;
between Taiwan and China - specifically the question of eventual&#xD;
unification - as well as domestic political and economic reform.&#xD;

Economy Taiwan&#xD;
&#xD;
Economy - overview:  Taiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy&#xD;
with gradually decreasing guidance of investment and foreign&#xD;
trade by government authorities. In keeping with this trend,&#xD;
some large government-owned banks and industrial firms are being&#xD;
privatized. Real growth in GDP has averaged about 8% during the&#xD;
past three decades. Exports have provided the primary impetus for&#xD;
industrialization. The trade surplus is substantial, and foreign&#xD;
reserves are the world's third largest. Agriculture contributes 2%&#xD;
to GDP, down from 35% in 1952. Traditional labor-intensive industries&#xD;
are steadily being moved offshore and replaced with more capital- and&#xD;
technology-intensive industries.  Taiwan has become a major investor in&#xD;
China, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam; 50,000&#xD;
Taiwanese businesses are established in China. Because of its conservative&#xD;
financial approach and its entrepreneurial strengths, Taiwan suffered&#xD;
little compared with many of its neighbors from the Asian financial&#xD;
crisis in 1998-99. The global economic downturn, however, combined&#xD;
with poor policy coordination by the new administration and increasing&#xD;
bad debts in the banking system, pushed Taiwan into recession in 2001,&#xD;
the first whole year of negative growth since 1947.  Unemployment also&#xD;
reached a level not seen since the 1970s oil crisis.&#xD;

Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
United Kingdom&#xD;
&#xD;
Background:  Great Britain, the dominant industrial and maritime power&#xD;
of the 19th century, played a leading role in developing parliamentary&#xD;
democracy and in advancing literature and science. At its zenith, the&#xD;
British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth's surface. The&#xD;
first half of the 20th century saw the UK's strength seriously depleted&#xD;
in two World Wars. The second half witnessed the dismantling of the&#xD;
Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous&#xD;
European nation. As one of five permanent members of the UN Security&#xD;
Council, a founding member of NATO, and of the Commonwealth, the UK&#xD;
pursues a global approach to foreign policy; it currently is weighing&#xD;
the degree of its integration with continental Europe. A member of the&#xD;
EU, it chose to remain outside the European Monetary Union for the time&#xD;
being. Constitutional reform is also a significant issue in the UK. The&#xD;
Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Northern&#xD;
Ireland Assembly were established in 1999.&#xD;

levels and intends to meet the legally binding target and move towards a&#xD;
domestic goal of a 20% cut in emissions by 2010); by 2005 the Government&#xD;
aims to reduce the amount of industrial and commercial waste disposed&#xD;
of in landfill sites to 85% of 1998 levels and to recycle or compost at&#xD;
least 25% of household waste, increasing to 33% by 2015; between 1998-99&#xD;

Economy United Kingdom&#xD;
&#xD;
Economy - overview:  The UK, a leading trading power and financial center,&#xD;
is one of the quartet of trillion dollar economies of Western Europe. Over&#xD;
the past two decades the government has greatly reduced public ownership&#xD;
and contained the growth of social welfare programs. Agriculture is&#xD;
intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by European standards,&#xD;
producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the labor force.&#xD;
The UK has large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves; primary energy&#xD;
production accounts for 10% of GDP, one of the highest shares of&#xD;
any industrial nation. Services, particularly banking, insurance, and&#xD;
business services, account by far for the largest proportion of GDP while&#xD;
industry continues to decline in importance. GDP growth slipped in 2001&#xD;
as the global downturn, the high value of the pound, and the bursting&#xD;
of the &quot;&quot;new economy&quot;&quot; bubble hurt manufacturing and exports. Still, the&#xD;
economy is one of the strongest in Europe; inflation, interest rates,&#xD;
and unemployment remain low, and the government expects growth of 2% to&#xD;
2.5% in 2002. The relatively good economic performance has complicated&#xD;
the BLAIR government's efforts to make a case for Britain to join the&#xD;
European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The Prime Minister has&#xD;
pledged to hold a public referendum if membership meets Chancellor of&#xD;
the Exchequer BROWN's five economic &quot;&quot;tests.&quot;&quot; Scheduled for assessment&#xD;
by mid-2003, the tests will determine whether joining EMU would have a&#xD;
positive effect on British investment, employment, and growth. Critics&#xD;
point out, however, that the economy is thriving outside of EMU, and&#xD;
they point to public opinion polls that continue to show a majority of&#xD;
Britons opposed to the single currency.&#xD;

&#xD;
Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
United States&#xD;
&#xD;
Background:  Britain's American colonies broke with the mother country&#xD;
in 1776 and were recognized as the new nation of the United States of&#xD;
America following the Treaty of Paris in 1783. During the 19th and 20th&#xD;
centuries, 37 new states were added to the original 13 as the nation&#xD;
expanded across the North American continent and acquired a number of&#xD;
overseas possessions. The two most traumatic experiences in the nation's&#xD;
history were the Civil War (1861-65) and the Great Depression of the&#xD;
1930s. Buoyed by victories in World Wars I and II and the end of the Cold&#xD;
War in 1991, the US remains the world's most powerful nation-state. The&#xD;
economy is marked by steady growth, low unemployment and inflation,&#xD;
and rapid advances in technology.&#xD;

Economy United States&#xD;
&#xD;
Economy - overview:  The US has the largest and most technologically&#xD;
powerful economy in the world, with a per capita GDP of $36,300. In this&#xD;
market-oriented economy, private individuals and business firms make&#xD;
most of the decisions, and the federal and state governments buy needed&#xD;
goods and services predominantly in the private marketplace. US business&#xD;
firms enjoy considerably greater flexibility than their counterparts&#xD;
in Western Europe and Japan in decisions to expand capital plant, lay&#xD;
off surplus workers, and develop new products. At the same time, they&#xD;
face higher barriers to entry in their rivals' home markets than the&#xD;
barriers to entry of foreign firms in US markets. US firms are at or near&#xD;
the forefront in technological advances, especially in computers and in&#xD;
medical, aerospace, and military equipment, although their advantage has&#xD;
narrowed since the end of World War II. The onrush of technology largely&#xD;
explains the gradual development of a &quot;&quot;two-tier labor market&quot;&quot; in which&#xD;
those at the bottom lack the education and the professional/technical&#xD;
skills of those at the top and, more and more, fail to get comparable&#xD;
pay raises, health insurance coverage, and other benefits. Since 1975,&#xD;
practically all the gains in household income have gone to the top 20%&#xD;
of households. The years 1994-2000 witnessed solid increases in real&#xD;
output, low inflation rates, and a drop in unemployment to below 5%. The&#xD;
year 2001 witnessed the end of the boom psychology and performance,&#xD;
with output increasing only 0.3% and unemployment and business failures&#xD;
rising substantially. The response to the terrorist attacks of September&#xD;
11 showed the remarkable resilience of the economy. Moderate recovery is&#xD;
expected in 2002, with the GDP growth rate rising to 2.5% or more. A major&#xD;
short-term problem in first half 2002 was a sharp decline in the stock&#xD;
market, fueled in part by the exposure of dubious accounting practices in&#xD;
some major corporations. Long-term problems include inadequate investment&#xD;
in economic infrastructure, rapidly rising medical and pension costs of&#xD;
an aging population, sizable trade deficits, and stagnation of family&#xD;
income in the lower economic groups.&#xD;

Uruguay&#xD;
&#xD;
Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
Uruguay&#xD;
&#xD;
Background:  A violent Marxist urban guerrilla movement, the Tupamaros,&#xD;
launched in the late 1960s, led Uruguay's president to agree to military&#xD;
control of his administration in 1973. By the end of the year the rebels&#xD;
had been crushed, but the military continued to expand its hold throughout&#xD;
the government. Civilian rule was not restored until 1985.  Uruguay's&#xD;
political and labor conditions are among the freest on the continent.&#xD;
&#xD;
Geography Uruguay&#xD;
&#xD;
Location:  Southern South America, bordering the South Atlantic Ocean,&#xD;

occasional violent wind which blows north from the Argentine pampas),&#xD;
droughts, floods; because of the absence of mountains, which act as&#xD;
weather barriers, all locations are particularly vulnerable to rapid&#xD;
changes from weather fronts&#xD;

Economy Uruguay&#xD;
&#xD;
Economy - overview:  Uruguay's economy is characterized by an&#xD;
export-oriented agricultural sector, a well-educated workforce,&#xD;
and high levels of social spending. After averaging growth of 5%&#xD;
annually in 1996-98, in 1999-2001 the economy suffered from lower&#xD;
demand in Argentina and Brazil, which together account for nearly&#xD;
half of Uruguay's exports. Despite the severity of the trade shocks,&#xD;
Uruguay's financial indicators remained more stable than those of its&#xD;
neighbors, a reflection of its solid reputation among investors and its&#xD;
investment-grade sovereign bond rating - one of only two in South America.&#xD;
Challenges for the government of President Jorge BATLLE include reducing&#xD;
the budget deficit, expanding Uruguay's trade ties beyond its Mercosur&#xD;
trade partners, and reducing the costs of public services. GDP fell by&#xD;
